# platonic-rotation
 
## introduction
At the root of 3D rendering is the usage of basic matrix multiplcation to convert three-dimensional points (x,y,z) into two-dimensional coordinates (x,y). Using OpenCV, I developed a visualization of the application of projection and rotation matrices on four platonic solids (cube, octahedron, isocadehron, & dodecahedron).

## run my code
In order to excute the code you must have OpenCV set up on your personal computer. Refer to https://docs.opencv.org/master/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html (Windows) and https://medium.com/@jaskaranvirdi/setting-up-opencv-and-c-development-environment-in-xcode-b6027728003 (Mac/Linux) for OpenCV installation instructions.
